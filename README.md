# 🖼️➡️📄➡️🔊 Image-Based Text-to-Speech Converter

Transform any image containing text into a spoken audio file using this Python-based tool. The script seamlessly combines OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and text-to-speech technologies to bring images to life—no copy-pasting required.

## 🧰 What You'll Need

Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x  
- `pytesseract` for OCR functionality  
- `Pillow` for image handling  
- `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) for audio output  
- Tesseract-OCR engine

> 📌 *Note: Tesseract-OCR must be installed separately. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can run:*  
```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-to-audio
   cd image-to-audio
   ```

2. **Add Your Image File**  
   Place your `.jpg`, `.png`, or other supported image file into the project directory.

3. **Update File Path in Script**  
   Open `image_to_audio.py` and set the image path variable accordingly.

4. **Execute the Script**  
   ```bash
   python image_to_audio.py
   ```

5. **Playback the Output**  
   The audio will be saved as `output_audio.mp3`. Open it with any media player to hear the result.
